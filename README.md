## Context Aware Change Detection With Semi Supervised Learning IGARSS23

## Description:
Change detection using earth observation data plays a vital role in quantifying the impact of disasters in affected areas. While data sources like Sentinel-2 provide rich optical information, they are often hindered by cloud cover, limiting their usage in disaster scenarios. However, leveraging pre-disaster optical data can offer valuable contextual information about the area such as landcover type, vegetation cover, soil types, enabling a better understanding of the disaster's impact. In this study, we develop a model to assess the contribution of pre-disaster Sentinel-2 data in change detection tasks, focusing on disaster-affected areas. The proposed Context-Aware Change Detection Network (CACDN) utilizes a combination of pre-disaster Sentinel-2 data, pre and post-disaster Sentinel-1 data and ancillary Digital Elevation Models (DEM) data. The model is validated on flood and landslide detection and evaluated using three metrics: Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), Intersection over Union (IoU), and mean IoU. The preliminary results show significant improvement (4\%, AUPRC, 3-7\% IoU, 3-6\% mean IoU) in model's change detection capabilities when incorporated with pre-disaster optical data reflecting the effectiveness of using contextual information for accurate flood and landslide detection.
